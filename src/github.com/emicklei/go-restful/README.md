go-restful
==========

package for building REST-style Web Services using Google Go

REST asks developers to use HTTP methods explicitly and in a way that's consistent with the protocol definition. This basic REST design principle establishes a one-to-one mapping between create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations and HTTP methods. According to this mapping:

- To create a resource on the server, use POST.
- To retrieve a resource, use GET.
- To change the state of a resource or to update it, use PUT.
- To remove or delete a resource, use DELETE.
